# Breast Cancer Prediction using Gaussian Naive Bayes CLASSIFIER

This project demonstrates a supervised learning model to predict whether a breast cancer tumor is **malignant** or **benign** based on features from biopsy data. Early and accurate classification models like this have the potential to save lives by assisting medical professionals with crucial, time-sensitive decisions.

### üöÄ Implementation Steps

1.  **Data Loading & Exploration:** The dataset was loaded using `sklearn.datasets.load_breast_cancer`. Initial exploration was done using pandas (`.info()`, `.describe()`) and the target distribution was visualized with a pie chart.
2.  **Data Preprocessing:** The dataset was split into a **training set (67%)** and a **testing set (33%)** to ensure the model is evaluated on unseen data.
3.  **Model Building & Training:** A **Gaussian Naive Bayes** (`GaussianNB`) classifier was chosen for this task. The model was trained on the training data.
4.  **Evaluation:** The trained model's performance was tested on the held-out test data, and its predictive power was measured using the **accuracy score**.
