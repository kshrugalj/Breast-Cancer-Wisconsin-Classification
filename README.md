📌 Project Overview

The goal of this project is to build a supervised learning model that can predict whether a tumor is malignant or benign based on features extracted from breast cancer biopsies. This is a classic dataset often used to benchmark classification algorithms.

⚙️ Tech Stack
	•	Python
	•	Libraries: scikit-learn, pandas, matplotlib
	•	Algorithm: Gaussian Naive Bayes

⸻

🚀 Steps Implemented
	1.	Data Loading & Exploration
	•	Loaded dataset using sklearn.datasets.load_breast_cancer.
	•	Explored data with Pandas (.info(), .describe()) and visualized target distribution with a pie chart.
	2.	Data Preprocessing
	•	Split dataset into training and testing sets (train_test_split).
	3.	Model Building & Training
	•	Implemented Gaussian Naive Bayes classifier (GaussianNB).
	•	Trained model on 67% of the dataset.
	4.	Evaluation
	•	Predicted labels for test data.
	•	Measured model performance using accuracy score.

📊 Results
	•	The Gaussian Naive Bayes classifier achieved an accuracy of:

✅ ~97% (depending on random state & split)

⸻

🔍 Key Takeaways
	•	Naive Bayes is an effective baseline model for classification problems.
	•	Simple probabilistic approaches can achieve strong performance on medical datasets.
	•	Proper train-test splits and evaluation metrics are essential in assessing real-world applicability.

⸻

📂 Future Improvements
	•	Compare Naive Bayes with other classifiers (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, SVM).
	•	Apply cross-validation for more robust evaluation.
	•	Add feature importance analysis to understand which attributes most impact predictions.
	•	Experiment with hyperparameter tuning for improved accuracy.
